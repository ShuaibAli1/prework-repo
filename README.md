## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   W3Schools.com

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   Working on this project required me to learn new html syntax and capabilities, as well as investigate the numerous design options accessible in the style.css file. I immediately recognised the index.html file since I had previously used the Google Chrome web browser's "inspect element" feature. Adding buttons and text to an HTML website differs significantly from other coding languages, which confused me when I first learnt and implemented the necessary features. In c++, the button name goes with the button declaration, but the functionality goes underneath/next to it. The title shows beneath the HTML declaration, but the characteristics display in the button header, which puzzled me. I spent time investigating html syntax using the resources supplied in the pre-work instructions to understand why the syntax is the way it is. Another challenge was learning about the many design options for adding to the website. While creating and executing design options such as sizes and colors is very simple, I was more overwhelmed by the possibilities. I recently spent some time playing with different colours to observe how colours change based on which functions are invoked or what the user types in, which peaked my interest in website design and coding.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   My primary concern with web development is the functioning of the code rather than the design. I'm wondering if the functionalities in HTML may be provided by another coding language. When building a website, why is it required to use two coding languages, html and java? They have quite different syntaxes, and I don't see why java can't use its features to add text and shapes to the website. I'm also confused by the website's css, html, and java file integration. Using several files, in my previous understanding, demands the use of import or include statements to join them, but despite sharing variable names and function calls, these files appear to be independent. I had to include the other files in the header section of the html file.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   Adding other buttons with distinct sounds, as well as having the game play a song instead of a pattern, are two more improvements that I believe would be interesting and unique. There can be many levels of difficulty; for example, on an easy level, the website may display the user which buttons are clicked and for how long, or on a tough level, the buttons may be concealed until the song is done, and the user must guess the song from the sounds played. This would require the production of a large number of different song patterns in different arrays. All of these different arrays may be merged into a larger array, which can then be used to choose a music array at random from the larger array.
